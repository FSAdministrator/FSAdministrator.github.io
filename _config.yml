  Hey there! My name is Felix and I am a System's Engineer at Timberlands Limited. I've worked as a Systems Enginner and IT Consultant for 5 years overall, and have a massive passion for the Digital / Technology space.

  In the years of working as a Systems Engineer, I have developed a large number of skills around the following topics: <mark>Asset Management</mark> <mark>Device Management / Laptop Deployment</mark> <mark>Systems Monitoring + Reporting</mark> <mark>Scripting Languages (Python, Ruby, HTML+CSS+JAVA, etc.)</mark> and <mark>Cloud Migration + Management</mark>.

  All of the above skills are a massive passion to me, and overall, the <mark>Best User Experience</mark> is my #1 goal with every role I take on, and I will always try my best to go above and beyond with all requests I take on!

  Outside of my job life, I like to play computer games and spend a large amount of time maintaining a server hosting service called "Stipe". This allows me to learn a lot around Hardware resource management, along with gaining more experience with VCenter. Finally, I do like to go for a swim in the blue lake from time to time, do some research around the most up to date hardware in the world, and catch up with friends outside of my local town!

          This project started off as one of my KPI's within the business, and become a larger passion project between me and a college! This project was formed in March 2020 and reached a stand-still around November 2020.

          The project utilized an Onsite Virtural Machine, and a web content management system called Drupal. We spent a large amount of time making sure that the GUI was user friendly, for both visitors and editors.

          Unfortunately this project came to a standstill after November due to a concern around public-facing information.

            This project was something that I wanted to develop since I started at Timberlands, and became a project that lead me through May to July 2021.

            The asset management system that I decided to utilize is "SNIPE-IT", a free, open source, asset managemnt system targeted towards IT teams across the world!

            This project has allowed for me to learn more about PHP, JAVA and CSS, and a API called "REST". This project has lead the Timberlands IT team to save a lot of time and money, and this system will help the company in the long run.

            Every company needs its networks properly administered and The Boring Compay is no exception. Digging holes is hard and I play my part making sure the whole company stays connected. I lead a team of 5 people and enjoy driving the company to try new technologies.
