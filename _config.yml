          This project started off as one of my KPI's within Timberlands, and become a larger passion project between me and a college! The website was brought in house to save cost and to allow for self management when required.

          The project utilised an On-Site Virtual Machine, and a web content management system called Drupal. We spent a large amount of time making sure that the GUI was user friendly, for both visitors and editors.

            It became apparent that Timberlands could strongly benefit with an asset management system. I decided to champion this project and gained the support of my manager using a cost-benefit Analysis.

            I choose [SNIPE-IT](https://snipeitapp.com/) as a free, open source system targeted towards IT Teams.

            This project enabled me to gain knowledge about PHP, JAVA and CSS, and an API called "REST". This project has led the Timberlands IT team to be more effective in storing assets digitally, and will assist future IT support in the long run.

            As users began to utilize the benefits of working from home, using video calling for most meetings, and using more of our cloud services, the IT team needed me to complete rollout of laptop devices across the company.

            My responsibilities in this rollout included training sessions, CyberSecurity Workshops, laptop purchases, Laptop building and Deployment, user management, and finally helpdesk management.

            This rollout took place in one of the toughest times for the team, as chip shortages, delays and COVID difficulties all added to the pressure of the rollout, making this project one of the most gratifying and rewarding achievements I've made while working at Timberlands.

              At the beginning of my employment with Timberlands, I learned about how to be an IT support person and how their systems work in the day-to-day job.

              Before the laptop rollout, Timberlands operated on a private cloud structure called Citrix. The massive advantage of this system was the amount of control and support that it offered to the IT team and staff members.

              Since the start of my employment at Timberlands, they have now shifted towards an individual device structure, as this was the best way to fully utilize cloud services that Microsoft provide.

              I work hard to make sure that our Users are looked after and cared for on-site and externally. A large amount of projects and knowledge has come from working at Timberlands, and I really enjoy working with Wayne Pratt and Bryan Graham.
