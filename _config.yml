  Beyond my career, I'm committed to a balanced lifestyle. Hitting the gym, enjoying pickleball, playing Magic: The Gathering at card shops, or diving into video games are activities that are good for my well-being and social battery!
  Finally, my passion for technology doesn't stop at 5pm; I'm always on the lookout for the latest technology trends, as it's a personal interest that keeps me engaged. My dedication to both my career and personal growth is what fuels my continuous advancement in the world of IT.
